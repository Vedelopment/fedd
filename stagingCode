- take text input from form (or check box data?)
- turn this input into a query string
- take the string and add it to the ajax call route
- go to restaurants and retrieve instances with .find?
- also on form submit, run handlebars to render instances that match query

Query Parameters in Express

In Express, query string parameters are available in the request.query object. Let's add our first route to practice query params.

app.get("/thank", function (request, response) {
  console.log(request.query);
  var name = request.query.name;
  response.send('Thank you, ' + name + '!');
});
